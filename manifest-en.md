#Presentation of the current edition : the A. Book
The Cité du design will release a reference book on most profitable firm ever, which has embedded design issues in its core from the very begining. This publication will analyse Apple’s past and current designed products with a unexpected point view : details. Relying on recognized experts’ voices, but also on unpublished design research work based on an iconographic work [developped in the laboratory], the ambition is to understand the different levels of design invested by the firm to produce its artifacts and its interfaces. Supported by essays and several interviews in the books, the author will put into perspective where the design project appears within the range of products developed by Apple. 

Why design is such a fundamental issue today for leading companies, and how many roles does design play? 
A global and panoptic analysis, set against a methodology for observation of details, will cross two forms of speech: the theoric one and the technical one. Both in order to enlighten the reader on the strong and unique design approach of the Apple company.

This project aims to be a reference book, making the link between technical culture and design culture. Conducted by Cedric Scandella, it will place us at the heart of the largest industrial and technological project for the mass-market in the last thirty years, thanks to the intervention of the world’s top contributors on the issue.
This book will position the City of design as a leading actor of thinking and studies about industrial design. Published in two versions, English and French, and developed in a digital book, the publication will reveal the international expertise of the Cité du design in both, technical culture and design culture.

#General presentation of the editions of the Cite du design
Aiming to be a beacon for activities and dynamics within the city in all its dimensions, the [City du design](http://www.citedudesign.com/fr/home/) position itself as a major actor in the promotion and public awerness of design in everyday life, in France.

With this in mind, dissemination and creation of a corpus of major texts about what is design and what it stands for, is a fundamental issue for Cité du design’s publications. Each published books by Cité du design éditions has no equivalent in the French publishing field and, furthermore, it targets a wide audience (specialists, actors, but also teachers, students, educators, curious, amateurs and the general public).

The purpose is twofold: to affirm the role of the Cité du design, in France and internationally speaking, as a promoter and key-holder of a design vision in order to develop innovative practices, jobs, history and to promote new approaches.
